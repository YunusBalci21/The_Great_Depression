 ### Events ###
 
 # First Five-Year Plan
 sov_depression.1.t:0 "The First Five-Year Plan"
 sov_depression.1.d:0 "While the capitalist world reels from economic collapse following the Wall Street Crash, the Soviet Union faces its own economic challenges. Comrade Stalin has implemented the First Five-Year Plan to rapidly industrialize our agricultural society. This ambitious program sets targets for heavy industry, energy production, and transportation that will transform the Soviet Union into a modern industrial power.\n\nThe plan calls for the collectivization of agriculture to increase production efficiency and transfer surplus labor to the industrial sector. New industrial cities will be built, and massive projects like the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station will provide power for our factories.\n\nThough the path ahead will be difficult, requiring sacrifice from all Soviet citizens, it will establish the foundation for our socialist economy and demonstrate the superiority of central planning over the chaotic capitalist market."
 sov_depression.1.a:0 "We will build socialism through industrialization!"
 
 # Collectivization Crisis
 sov_depression.2.t:0 "Collectivization Resistance"
 sov_depression.2.d:0 "The policy of agricultural collectivization has met with significant resistance from the kulaks and other peasants who refuse to surrender their land and livestock to the collective farms. Reports from the countryside detail acts of sabotage, slaughtered livestock, and violent confrontations with authorities.\n\nLocal party officials request guidance on how to proceed. Some advocate for easing the pace of collectivization to reduce resistance, while others argue that any compromise would be seen as weakness and embolden counter-revolutionary elements.\n\nComrade Stalin has made it clear that collectivization must proceed, but the tactical approach is under discussion. How should we respond to this resistance?"
 sov_depression.2.a:0 "Intensify efforts! Break kulak resistance by force!"
 sov_depression.2.b:0 "Temporarily slow the pace to reduce unrest."
 
 # Political Purges Begin
 sov_depression.3.t:0 "Enemies Within the Party"
 sov_depression.3.d:0 "Comrade Stalin has raised concerns about enemies and saboteurs within the Party who may be working to undermine our economic plans and collaborating with foreign powers. Evidence suggests that former Trotskyists and other opposition groups continue to operate secretly within our government and industrial management.\n\nThe NKVD has compiled lists of suspected conspirators and proposes a series of arrests and investigations to root out these elements. This would require significant resources and could temporarily disrupt some economic and political functions, but would secure the revolution against internal threats.\n\nHow should we proceed with addressing these potential enemies within?"
 sov_depression.3.a:0 "Begin the purges! The revolution must be protected!"
 sov_depression.3.b:0 "Focus on key suspects only to minimize disruption."
 
 # Limited Purges Aftermath
 sov_depression.3b.t:0 "Targeted Removals Complete"
 sov_depression.3b.d:0 "The limited purge of specific suspected oppositionists has been completed. Several former Trotskyists and rightists have been removed from their positions, tried, and sentenced for anti-party activities. By focusing on verified cases rather than conducting a broader sweep, we have maintained greater stability in party and government operations.\n\nHowever, some NKVD officials warn that many conspirators may remain undetected due to the limited scope of investigations. They recommend continued vigilance and possibly expanded investigations in the future."
 sov_depression.3b.a:0 "We have restored party unity for now."
 
 # The Great Purge
 sov_depression.4.t:0 "The Great Purge"
 sov_depression.4.d:0 "Evidence of a vast conspiracy against the Soviet state has been uncovered, allegedly involving high-ranking military officers, party officials, and foreign intelligence services. Comrade Stalin has ordered comprehensive measures to eliminate this threat through what will become known as the Great Purge.\n\nThe NKVD has prepared extensive lists of suspects across all sectors of Soviet society. The purge will be far-reaching, affecting the military, government, industry, and cultural institutions. Public trials of prominent figures will demonstrate the seriousness of the threat and the party's resolve to eliminate it.\n\nWhile this action will secure the revolution against internal enemies, it will also cause significant disruption. How should we focus our initial efforts?"
 sov_depression.4.a:0 "Focus on military leadership to secure the armed forces."
 sov_depression.4.b:0 "Target political opposition within the party first."
 
 # Border Conflict with Japan - Event Chain
 sov_depression.5.t:0 "Tensions on the Manchurian Border"
 sov_depression.5.d:0 "Reports from the Far East indicate increasing Japanese military activity along our border with Japanese-occupied Manchuria. Several minor incidents have already occurred, with Japanese troops crossing the border in what they claim are 'navigational errors.'\n\nOur local military commanders request guidance on how to respond to these provocations. Intelligence suggests these actions may be testing our resolve and military readiness in the region, possibly in preparation for more significant aggression.\n\nHow should we respond to these Japanese border activities?"
 sov_depression.5.a:0 "Strengthen our defenses but avoid escalation."
 sov_depression.5.b:0 "Show of force - deploy additional troops to the border."
 
 # Japan - Soviet Border Strengthened
 sov_depression.6.t:0 "Soviet Fortifications Increased"
 sov_depression.6.d:0 "Our intelligence services report that the Soviets are significantly strengthening their defenses along the Manchurian border. New bunkers, artillery positions, and reinforcements of infantry and tank units have been observed.\n\nThis defensive buildup suggests the Soviets are taking our border activities seriously but are not currently preparing for offensive operations. Military analysts suggest this improved defensive posture would make any potential incursion into Soviet territory more costly.\n\nHow should we respond to this Soviet defensive buildup?"
 sov_depression.6.a:0 "Reduce border activities to avoid escalation."
 sov_depression.6.b:0 "Deploy additional forces to maintain pressure."
 
 # Japan - Soviet Aggression
 sov_depression.7.t:0 "Soviet Military Buildup"
 sov_depression.7.d:0 "Reports from Manchuria indicate a significant Soviet military buildup along our border. Large formations of Soviet troops, including tank units and artillery, have been deployed to forward positions. Soviet aircraft have increased patrols along the frontier, occasionally crossing into our airspace.\n\nThis aggressive posturing represents a clear threat to our interests in Manchuria and potentially to the security of our Korean territories. Military commanders are requesting authorization to implement contingency plans in response to this Soviet provocation.\n\nHow should we address this Soviet aggression?"
 sov_depression.7.a:0 "Diplomatic protest and partial withdrawal to reduce tensions."
 sov_depression.7.b:0 "Military countermeasures - reinforce our positions."
 
 # Japanese Withdrawal
 sov_depression.8.t:0 "Japanese Forces Reducing Border Presence"
 sov_depression.8.d:0 "Reports from the Far Eastern Military District indicate that Japanese forces have reduced their provocative activities along our border with Manchuria. Observation posts note fewer patrols and a general withdrawal of some units from forward positions.\n\nThis apparent de-escalation suggests our defensive measures have successfully deterred Japanese aggression for the time being. While this reduces immediate tensions, military commanders caution that we should maintain vigilance as Japanese intentions in the region remain expansionist."
 sov_depression.8.a:0 "A temporary victory for Soviet resolve."
 
 # Japanese Reinforcements
 sov_depression.9.t:0 "Japan Reinforces Border Positions"
 sov_depression.9.d:0 "Intelligence reports confirm that the Japanese have responded to our military preparations by significantly reinforcing their positions along the Manchurian border. Additional infantry, artillery, and air units have been observed moving to the frontier area.\n\nThis escalation increases the risk of a more serious confrontation. Local commanders report several new skirmishes as patrols from both sides encounter each other with increasing frequency. The situation remains tense, with a risk of unintended escalation into a larger conflict.\n\nHow should we respond to this Japanese reinforcement?"
 sov_depression.9.a:0 "Seek diplomatic channels to reduce tensions."
 sov_depression.9.b:0 "Further military preparations - we will not be intimidated."
 
 # Japanese Submission
 sov_depression.10.t:0 "Japan Backs Down"
 sov_depression.10.d:0 "Our strong response to Japanese provocations has produced results. Reports from the Far East indicate that Japanese forces have significantly reduced their presence along our border and ceased their provocative activities.\n\nThis diplomatic and military victory demonstrates the effectiveness of our firm stance against fascist aggression. While Japanese ambitions in the region undoubtedly remain, they have been forced to recognize Soviet power and reconsider their aggressive posture toward our territory.\n\nThis outcome strengthens our position in the Far East and may discourage further Japanese adventures against Soviet interests."
 sov_depression.10.a:0 "Soviet power prevails!"
 
 # Border Tensions Resolved
 sov_depression.11.t:0 "Border Agreement Reached"
 sov_depression.11.d:0 "Through diplomatic channels, we have reached a tentative agreement with Japan regarding border procedures along the Manchurian frontier. The agreement establishes protocols for patrols, communication during incidents, and demarcation of disputed border sections.\n\nWhile tensions remain high, this practical arrangement should reduce the risk of unintended escalation and provide a framework for managing future disputes. Local military commanders have been instructed on the new procedures.\n\nThis diplomatic solution allows both sides to maintain their positions while reducing the immediate risk of conflict."
 sov_depression.11.a:0 "A pragmatic solution to the current crisis."
 
 # Border War with Japan
 sov_depression.12.t:0 "Border War with Japan"
 sov_depression.12.d:0 "The situation along the Manchurian border has escalated into open combat after Japanese forces launched a series of coordinated attacks against our positions. Soviet border units are engaged in heavy fighting with Japanese troops supported by aircraft and light tanks.\n\nGeneral Grigori Stern has taken command of our forces in the region and is organizing a counter-offensive. Reports indicate fierce resistance from our troops, but the situation remains fluid as both sides commit additional forces to the battle.\n\nThe Politburo has ordered full mobilization of the Far Eastern Military District and authorized whatever measures necessary to repel this Japanese aggression."
 sov_depression.12.a:0 "We will teach the Japanese imperialists a harsh lesson!"
 
 # Border Tensions Resolved (Japanese Version)
 sov_depression.11b.t:0 "Border Agreement with Soviets"
 sov_depression.11b.d:0 "Our diplomatic corps has negotiated an agreement with the Soviet Union regarding border procedures along the Manchurian frontier. The arrangement establishes protocols for patrols, dispute resolution mechanisms, and clearer demarcation of the border in contested areas.\n\nWhile this agreement requires some concessions on specific patrol routes, it reduces the risk of unintended incidents escalating into larger conflicts. Our military commanders in Manchuria have received instructions on implementing these new procedures.\n\nThis temporary diplomatic solution allows us to maintain our strategic position while avoiding a premature conflict with Soviet forces."
 sov_depression.11b.a:0 "A necessary compromise for now."
 
 # Border War with Soviets
 sov_depression.12b.t:0 "War Breaks Out with Soviet Union"
 sov_depression.12b.d:0 "Soviet forces have launched a major offensive against our positions along the Manchurian border. Heavy artillery bombardment preceded infantry and tank assaults at multiple points along the frontier. Our border units are engaged in intense combat to halt the Soviet advance.\n\nGeneral Kenkichi Ueda has taken personal command of the defense and is coordinating the deployment of reinforcements from deeper within Manchuria. Air units have been scrambled to provide support to our ground forces and to counter Soviet air activity.\n\nThe government has authorized full military response to this Soviet aggression, with additional forces being prepared for deployment to the front."
 sov_depression.12b.a:0 "The Soviet bear will regret this provocation!"
 
 # Hunger in Ukraine
 sov_depression.13.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Ukraine"
 sov_depression.13.d:0 "Reports from Ukraine indicate a severe agricultural crisis developing as a result of collectivization policies and grain requisition quotas. Local party officials warn of widespread food shortages in rural areas and growing hunger among the peasantry. Some areas report deaths from starvation, though the full extent remains unclear due to communication difficulties.\n\nThe NKVD attributes these problems to kulak sabotage and hoarding, recommending increased enforcement of collection quotas and more aggressive measures against resisters. However, some officials suggest temporarily reducing quotas and providing emergency relief to prevent a larger catastrophe.\n\nThis situation threatens both agricultural production and political stability in this vital region."
 sov_depression.13.a:0 "Increase enforcement - we cannot show weakness to kulak sabotage."
 sov_depression.13.b:0 "Provide emergency relief and temporarily reduce quotas."
 
 # Resume Collectivization?
 sov_depression.14.t:0 "Resuming Collectivization"
 sov_depression.14.d:0 "The temporary measures taken to address the agricultural crisis have somewhat stabilized the situation in Ukraine and other agricultural regions. Food production has improved somewhat, and the most severe shortages have been addressed.\n\nThe Politburo must now decide how to proceed with the collectivization program. Some argue for resuming the original aggressive timeline to complete socialist transformation of agriculture. Others suggest a more gradual approach that would maintain some private farming alongside collective farms to ensure stable food production.\n\nThis decision will significantly impact both our agricultural output and political stability in rural areas."
 sov_depression.14.a:0 "Resume full collectivization immediately."
 sov_depression.14.b:0 "Implement a mixed approach with some private farming allowed."
 
 # World News Events
 news.sov_depression.1.t:0 "Purges Begin in Soviet Union"
 news.sov_depression.1.d:0 "Reports from Moscow indicate that a wave of arrests has begun targeting alleged enemies within the Communist Party and Soviet government. Several prominent officials have disappeared from public view, while others have been formally charged with conspiracy against the state and counter-revolutionary activities.\n\nForeign observers suggest these actions represent a consolidation of power by Joseph Stalin, who has been steadily eliminating potential rivals since Lenin's death. The current economic pressures facing the Soviet Union may have accelerated this process as the regime seeks to suppress any internal opposition to its industrialization policies.\n\nThe ultimate scope of these purges remains unclear, but they signal growing political repression within the Soviet system as it confronts both internal and external challenges."
 news.sov_depression.1.a:0 "Troubling developments within the Soviet regime."
 news.sov_depression.1.b:0 "These measures are necessary to protect the revolution."
 
 news.sov_depression.2.t:0 "Great Purge Underway in Soviet Union"
 news.sov_depression.2.d:0 "A massive political purge has begun in the Soviet Union, with thousands of arrests reported across all levels of government, military, and society. Public show trials in Moscow have featured shocking confessions from former high-ranking Communist officials who claim to have participated in vast conspiracies against the Soviet state.\n\nParticularly notable is the targeting of military leadership, with several prominent Red Army generals arrested on charges of treason and espionage. Foreign military observers express concern that these purges will significantly weaken Soviet military capabilities at a time of growing international tensions.\n\nAs the wave of arrests continues, a climate of fear has reportedly spread throughout Soviet society, with citizens increasingly reluctant to express any opinions that might be interpreted as disloyal to Stalin's leadership."

 news.sov_depression.3.d:0 "Fighting has broken out along the border between Soviet territory and Japanese-controlled Manchuria, with both sides reporting significant military engagements. The conflict appears to have begun after months of escalating tensions and minor border incidents.\n\nBoth Moscow and Tokyo claim the other side initiated hostilities, with contradictory reports about which forces crossed the border first. What is clear is that substantial military forces are now engaged, with artillery exchanges, air combat, and ground operations reported along multiple sectors of the frontier.\n\nMilitary analysts question whether this conflict will remain contained as a border incident or escalate into a larger war between the Soviet Union and Japan. Both nations have been building up their forces in the region for some time, suggesting at least partial preparation for such a confrontation."

 news.sov_depression.4.t:0 "Famine Reports Emerge from Soviet Ukraine"
 news.sov_depression.4.d:0 "Disturbing reports of widespread famine have emerged from Soviet Ukraine, where agricultural collectivization policies appear to have created a severe food crisis. Refugees crossing into Poland and Romania describe desperate conditions in rural areas, with entire villages suffering from starvation and disease.\n\nThe Soviet government denies these reports, attributing food shortages to sabotage by kulaks (wealthy peasants) resisting socialist transformation of agriculture. However, independent observers suggest the scale of the crisis far exceeds what could be explained by isolated resistance.\n\nThe situation highlights the human cost of the Soviet Union's rapid industrialization program, which has prioritized urban industrial development at the expense of agricultural sectors and redirected food resources from the countryside to cities and export markets."
