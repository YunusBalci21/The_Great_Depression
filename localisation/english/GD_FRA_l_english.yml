 # Event Localization
 gd_france.1.t:0 "The Depression Reaches France"
 gd_france.1.d:0 "The financial crash that began on Wall Street has now reached France. While our banking system has been largely insulated from the immediate effects of the American crisis, our export industries are already experiencing significant declines in orders. Industrial production is beginning to contract, and unemployment is rising across the country. The government is scrambling to assess the situation and determine appropriate responses, though our commitment to the gold standard limits monetary policy options. As the crisis deepens, social tensions are likely to increase, adding to the chronic political instability of the Third Republic."
 gd_france.1.a:0 "We must maintain economic stability"
 
 gd_france.2.t:0 "Government Collapse"
 gd_france.2.d:0 "The economic crisis has claimed its first political victim as the government has collapsed following disagreements over how to respond to the Depression. This is hardly unprecedented in the Third Republic, which has seen frequent ministerial changes even in the best of times. However, the current economic challenges make this governmental instability particularly concerning, as it undermines the possibility of coherent, long-term responses to the crisis. As political leaders negotiate to form a new cabinet, the fundamental divisions over economic policy, social welfare, and international relations remain unresolved."
 gd_france.2.a:0 "Install a new government"
 
 gd_france.3.t:0 "February 1934 Crisis"
 gd_france.3.d:0 "Paris has erupted in violence as far-right leagues and their supporters staged massive demonstrations following the Stavisky Affair scandal. The protests turned violent when demonstrators attempted to storm the Chamber of Deputies, leading to deadly clashes with police. With 15 dead and over 1,500 injured, this is the most serious political violence France has experienced in decades. The crisis has brought down another government and raised serious concerns about the stability of the Third Republic itself, with some openly calling for authoritarian solutions to France's political and economic problems."
 gd_france.3.a:0 "Crack down on the rioters"
 gd_france.3.b:0 "Form a government of National Unity"
 
 gd_france.4.t:0 "The Popular Front Victory"
 gd_france.4.d:0 "The elections have resulted in a historic victory for the left-wing coalition known as the Popular Front. Led by Léon Blum, this alliance of Socialists, Radicals, and Communists campaigned on a platform of anti-fascism, social reforms, and economic intervention to address the Depression. The victory comes amid growing working-class militancy, with factory occupations and strikes spreading across the country. As Blum prepares to form France's first Socialist-led government, there are high expectations for significant policy changes, though resistance from business interests and right-wing groups is certain."
 gd_france.4.a:0 "A new era begins"
 
 gd_france.5.t:0 "The Matignon Agreements"
 gd_france.5.d:0 "In response to the wave of strikes and factory occupations that followed the Popular Front's electoral victory, Prime Minister Léon Blum has negotiated a historic agreement between employers and labor unions. The Matignon Agreements grant significant concessions to workers, including wage increases of 7-15%, recognition of collective bargaining rights, and the establishment of worker delegates in factories. While these agreements have helped end the immediate crisis, they represent a major shift in French labor relations and have earned the enmity of many business leaders and conservatives who see them as a dangerous capitulation to working-class demands."
 gd_france.5.a:0 "Sign the agreements"
 
 gd_france.6.t:0 "Devaluation of the Franc"
 gd_france.6.d:0 "After years of defending the franc's gold parity despite mounting economic pressures, France has finally devalued its currency. This decision, coordinated with Britain and the United States in what is being called the Tripartite Monetary Agreement, marks the end of France's stubborn adherence to the gold standard at pre-Depression rates. The devaluation should boost exports by making French goods more competitive internationally and give the government greater monetary flexibility. However, it represents a significant political defeat for the financial orthodoxy that has dominated French economic policy since the stabilization under Poincaré."
 gd_france.6.a:0 "A necessary adjustment"
 
 gd_france.7.t:0 "The Spanish Civil War"
 gd_france.7.d:0 "Civil war has erupted in Spain following a military uprising against the democratically elected Republican government. This conflict on our southern border presents France with difficult choices. The Popular Front government naturally sympathizes with the Spanish Republic, but fears that direct intervention could provoke a wider European conflict. Meanwhile, right-wing elements within France support the Spanish Nationalists. As refugees begin crossing the Pyrenees and both sides in Spain seek international support, we must decide our position on this conflict that threatens to become a proxy war between democracy and fascism."
 gd_france.7.a:0 "Maintain strict non-intervention"
 gd_france.7.b:0 "Provide covert assistance to the Republic"
 
 gd_france.10.t:0 "Unrest in North Africa"
 gd_france.10.d:0 "The economic crisis has exacerbated tensions in French North Africa, particularly in Algeria and Morocco. Economic hardship has intensified local grievances and strengthened nationalist sentiments among the indigenous populations. Several demonstrations have turned violent, requiring military intervention to restore order. Colonial administrators are divided between those advocating stricter control measures and those suggesting limited reforms to address the most pressing economic and social issues. How we handle this unrest could have significant implications for the stability of France's North African territories."
 gd_france.10.a:0 "Strengthen security measures"
 gd_france.10.b:0 "Implement limited economic reforms"
 
 gd_france.11.t:0 "Indochina Situation"
 gd_france.11.d:0 "Reports from Indochina indicate growing economic difficulties and political unrest in France's valuable Far Eastern possession. The global depression has severely impacted the colony's export-oriented economy, particularly rubber and rice production. Communist and nationalist groups are exploiting this hardship to build support among the local population. The colonial administration has requested additional resources for both security operations and economic development projects to stabilize the situation. Paris must decide how to respond to these challenges in a distant but strategically important colony."
 gd_france.11.a:0 "Prioritize security and control"
 gd_france.11.b:0 "Implement colonial development plan"
 
 gd_france.20.t:0 "Military Doctrine Debate"
 gd_france.20.d:0 "As international tensions rise and rearmament begins, a significant debate has emerged within the French military establishment about future doctrine. The dominant view, championed by General Gamelin and others, emphasizes defensive operations, fortifications like the Maginot Line, and methodical battle plans that maximize France's defensive advantages. However, a minority faction led by officers like Colonel de Gaulle advocates for more offensive doctrines centered on mechanized forces and mobility. This fundamental disagreement reflects different lessons drawn from the Great War and different assessments of France's strategic situation."
 gd_france.20.a:0 "Adopt a defensive posture"
 gd_france.20.b:0 "Develop a more mobile, offensive approach"
 
 gd_france.21.t:0 "The Munich Conference"
 gd_france.21.d:0 "Prime Minister Daladier has returned from Munich where he, along with British Prime Minister Chamberlain, met with Hitler and Mussolini to resolve the Czechoslovakian crisis. The resulting agreement cedes the Sudetenland to Germany in exchange for Hitler's promise that this will be his last territorial demand. Despite being greeted by cheering crowds relieved at the avoidance of war, Daladier himself reportedly expressed pessimism about the durability of the agreement. France's abandonment of its Czech ally, though diplomatically coordinated with Britain, represents a significant retreat from the security system established after the Great War."
 gd_france.21.a:0 "Peace in our time"
 gd_france.21.b:0 "We cannot abandon our Czech allies"
 
 gd_france.30.t:0 "France Recovers from the Depression"
 gd_france.30.d:0 "After years of economic hardship, France has finally emerged from the Great Depression. Industrial production has returned to pre-crash levels, unemployment has significantly decreased, and financial markets have stabilized. The policies implemented during the crisis years, despite political controversy, have ultimately facilitated recovery. However, the experience has left lasting changes in France's economy, labor relations, and political landscape. With economic recovery secured, attention is increasingly turning to the deteriorating international situation and the military challenges that may lie ahead."

The riots, triggered by the Stavisky Affair scandal but fueled by deeper political and economic grievances, have resulted in 15 deaths and over 1,500 injuries. The French government has fallen in the wake of the crisis, the second cabinet to collapse this month.
