 # Hyperinflation Memory
 germany.1.t:0 "Memory of Hyperinflation"
 germany.1.d:0 "The stock market crash in America has triggered fears of a repeat of the 1923 hyperinflation, which devastated the German middle class and eroded faith in the Weimar Republic. Though our current economic situation is different, the psychological impact of those memories cannot be underestimated. Many Germans are hoarding gold and foreign currency, further destabilizing our financial system."
 germany.1.a:0 "The scars run deep"
 
 # Young Plan
 germany.2.t:0 "The Young Plan"
 germany.2.d:0 "The Young Plan, negotiated before the economic crisis, was intended to reduce Germany's reparation burden. However, in the current climate, even these reduced payments seem unsustainable. Nationalist groups are using the plan as proof that foreign powers seek to keep Germany subjugated forever, while moderates argue that rejecting the plan would destroy any goodwill with the Allies."
 germany.2.a:0 "Accept the plan despite the difficulties"
 germany.2.b:0 "Protest the continuing burden"
 
 # German Banking Crisis
 germany.3.t:0 "German Banking Crisis"
 germany.3.d:0 "The failure of Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, has triggered a banking crisis that has spread to Germany. The Danatbank, one of our largest financial institutions, has collapsed, and others are teetering on the brink. Panicked depositors are withdrawing funds en masse, threatening the entire financial system. Without immediate intervention, the German banking system could completely collapse."
 germany.3.a:0 "This threatens the entire economy"
 
 # Brüning's Emergency Decrees
 germany.4.t:0 "Brüning's Emergency Decrees"
 germany.4.d:0 "Chancellor Heinrich Brüning, faced with economic collapse and a deadlocked Reichstag, has proposed a series of emergency decrees using Article 48 of the constitution. These measures include wage and price reductions, tax increases, and spending cuts. While potentially necessary to stabilize the economy, these austerity measures will undoubtedly increase public suffering and political unrest."
 germany.4.a:0 "Implement the emergency decrees"
 germany.4.b:0 "Seek alternative solutions"
 
 # Rise of the NSDAP
 germany.5.t:0 "Rise of the NSDAP"
 germany.5.d:0 "The economic crisis and political instability have fueled the rise of extremist parties, with the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) making dramatic gains in recent elections. Led by Adolf Hitler, the party blames the Weimar Republic, the Treaty of Versailles, Jews, and communists for Germany's problems, promising national renewal through radical action. Their brownshirted SA paramilitaries have become an intimidating presence on German streets."
 germany.5.a:0 "A concerning development"
 
 # Von Papen Government
 germany.6.t:0 "Von Papen Forms Government"
 germany.6.d:0 "Following Brüning's resignation, President Hindenburg has appointed Franz von Papen as Chancellor. Von Papen, a conservative aristocrat with minimal popular support, heads a 'cabinet of barons' comprised mainly of noblemen and industrialists. With little backing in the Reichstag, this government will rely heavily on presidential emergency decrees to govern, further weakening Germany's democratic institutions."
 germany.6.a:0 "A government without popular support"
 
 # Presidential Election
 germany.7.t:0 "Presidential Election"
 germany.7.d:0 "The Presidential election has concluded with the aging Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg defeating Adolf Hitler. Despite Hitler's energetic campaign and the NSDAP's growing popularity, many Germans still trust the 84-year-old war hero to provide stability in these troubled times. However, with over 13 million votes for Hitler, the NSDAP has demonstrated its considerable popular support."
 germany.7.a:0 "Hindenburg remains President"
 
 # Hitler Appointed Chancellor
 germany.8.t:0 "Hitler Appointed Chancellor"
 germany.8.d:0 "President Hindenburg has appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany, with Franz von Papen as Vice-Chancellor. Conservative politicians believed they could control Hitler by surrounding him with traditional conservative ministers. Hitler's appointment comes after months of political intrigue and backroom deals. NSDAP supporters are celebrating in the streets, while others fear what this development means for German democracy."
 germany.8.a:0 "A new chapter in German history begins"
 
 # Reichstag Fire
 germany.9.t:0 "The Reichstag Fire"
 germany.9.d:0 "Last night, the Reichstag building was devastated by fire. The police have arrested Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch communist, at the scene. Nazi leaders immediately claimed the fire was part of a communist plot to overthrow the government. This incident provides an opportunity to implement emergency measures against the communist threat, though some suspect the Nazis themselves may have been involved."
 germany.9.a:0 "Use this to crush communist opposition"
 
 # Enabling Act
 germany.10.t:0 "The Enabling Act"
 germany.10.d:0 "Following the Reichstag fire, the government has proposed the 'Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich,' commonly known as the Enabling Act. This law would allow the Chancellor to enact laws without the approval of the Reichstag for a period of four years. With the Communist deputies arrested and the SA intimidating remaining opposition, the law is expected to pass, effectively ending German democracy."

 # Communist Uprising
 germany.11.t:0 "Communist Uprising"

The German state, already weakened by economic crisis, now faces an existential threat from within."
 germany.11.a:0 "The revolution has begun!"
 
 # Communist Victory

 # Democratic Stabilization
 germany.13.t:0 "Democratic Forces Prevail"

Though significant challenges remain, this represents a triumph for democratic governance in the face of extremism."
 germany.13.a:0 "Democracy will endure"
 
 # Economic Recovery Beginning
 germany.14.t:0 "First Signs of Recovery"
 germany.14.d:0 "After years of economic hardship, the first signs of recovery are appearing across Germany.

 germany.14.a:0 "At last, signs of improvement"
 
 # German Remilitarization of the Rhineland
 germany.15.t:0 "Remilitarize the Rhineland?"
 germany.15.d:0 "The Treaty of Versailles demilitarized the Rhineland, forbidding German military forces from entering this strategically important region bordering France.

 germany.15.b:0 "The time is not yet right"
 
 # French Response to Rhineland
 germany.16.t:0 "Germany Remilitarizes the Rhineland"
 germany.16.d:0 "German troops have entered the demilitarized Rhineland in direct violation of the Treaty of Versailles. This provocative action threatens France's security and challenges the post-war order. Our military advisors suggest that the German force is small and would likely retreat if challenged, but any military response risks escalation into open conflict."
 germany.16.a:0 "We must avoid another war at all costs"
 germany.16.b:0 "This violation cannot stand"
 
 # French Accept Remilitarization
 germany.17.t:0 "France Accepts Rhineland Remilitarization"
 germany.17.d:0 "France has chosen not to respond militarily to our remilitarization of the Rhineland.

 # French Oppose Remilitarization
 germany.18.t:0 "France Opposes Rhineland Remilitarization"

 germany.18.b:0 "We must withdraw to avoid war"

 germany.20.t:0 "Anschluss with Austria"
 germany.20.d:0 "With our growing strength and confidence, the time has come to fulfill the dream of uniting all Germans in a single Reich.

 germany.21.b:0 "Austria will remain independent!"

 # Austria Resists
 germany.23.t:0 "Austria Resists Anschluss"
 germany.23.d:0 "Contrary to expectations, the Austrian government has rejected our demand for Anschluss and is mobilizing its forces to resist. While their military is no match for ours, this defiance is an embarrassment and will necessitate the use of force to achieve our objectives. International opinion may also turn against us if we are forced to invade."
 germany.23.a:0 "They leave us no choice but war"

 # French Perspective on Cooperation
 germany.41.t:0 "Cooperation with Democratic Germany"
