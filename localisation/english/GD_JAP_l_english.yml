Our silk industry, which relies heavily on American consumers, has been particularly devastated. Government officials and business leaders are gathering in emergency meetings to determine how to respond to what may become the worst economic crisis in modern Japanese history."
 japan_depression.1.a:0 "This will have grave consequences for Japan."
 
 japan_depression.2.t:0 "The Manchurian Incident"
 japan_depression.2.d:0 "On September 18, 1931, an explosion occurred on the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railway near Mukden (now Shenyang). Although likely staged by Japanese officers, our Kwantung Army has blamed Chinese saboteurs and used this incident as justification to seize control of key points throughout Manchuria. This bold move, executed without authorization from Tokyo, presents the government with a fait accompli. While condemned internationally, the action has broad support among the Japanese public, who see it as a necessary step to secure vital resources and strategic depth."
